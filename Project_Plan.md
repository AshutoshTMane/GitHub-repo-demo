# HTTP-DDS Bridge Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

1.  Requirements, Research, and Design Documentation:
    *   1.1 - Detailed requirements gathering and analysis
    *   1.2 - Design of the IDL schema for relevant data types
    *   1.3 - Research state-of-the-art and plan for implementation details
    *   1.4 - Create architecture design diagrams of the bridge application
    *   1.5 - Documentation of requirements and design decisions
    *   1.6 - Risk assessment and analysis of potential integration challenges

2.  Bridge Implementation and Test Cases:
    *   2.1 - Implementation of the HTTP-DDS bridge in C++ and Python
    *   2.2 - Development of unit tests validate functionality
    *   2.3 - Design and implementation of end-to-end test cases for the whole system
    *   2.4 - Implementation of error handling, logging, and debugging tools

3.  Code Generation Implementation
    *   3.1 - Development of an IDL parser.
    *   3.2 - Implementation of code generation logic to translate IDL definitions between the two data formats
    *   3.3 - Unit testing of the code generation tool

4.  Generated Code Integration and Testing:
    *   4.1 - Integration of the generated code into the HTTP-DDS bridge 
    *   4.2 - Unit testing of the generated data conversion code
    *   4.3 - Testing the integrated bridge application with generated code
    *   4.4 - Performance metric analysis and optimization (latency, memory usage)

5.  Demonstration and Documentation:
    *   5.1 - Demonstration showcasing the bridge functionality and the process of adding/changing data types
    *   5.2 - Documentation of the project, including: the IDL code generation process, bridge application architecture, and test procedures
    *   5.3 - Final project report and presentation

6. Maintenance and Future Additions:
    *   6.1 - Document potential bugs and add improvements post-demonstration
    *   6.2 - Create a roadmap for future data conversions if necessary
